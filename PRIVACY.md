# Privacy Policy for D&D Beyond Translate Chrome Extension

We respect your privacy. D&D Beyond Translate Chrome Extension is committed to safeguarding your personal information. This extension:

1. **Does not Collect Data:** We do not collect, store, or process any user data.

2. **Optionally send untranslated content:** Disabled by default. Users can enable this function in the extension to help us by sending content that isn't translated yet, so we cna translate it. Just D&D Beyond texts are sent, no user data is touched on this process.

3. **Browser-Only Operation:** D&D Beyond Translate operates solely within your browser and does not gets or executes content from other sources. The only extra comunication with the "outside world" occurs if the user, consciously, enable the feature to send untranslated content. In this case, the only external communication that exists is to detect which content we have and which content is not translated, then sending the untranslated content to GitHub for translating.

4. **Focused Functionality:** The sole purpose of the extension is to translate D&D character sheets on the D&D Beyond website and convert measurement units to the International System (SI).

5. **License:** This extension is developed under the MIT license, allowing anyone to contribute to the development or create other extensions on top - or based - on this extension.
